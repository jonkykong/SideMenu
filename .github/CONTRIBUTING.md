# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in SideMenu!

I have received a surprising amount of questions about SideMenu since putting it up here. A few people in the community have identified some problems and helped contribute to SideMenu to make it better for everyone and I'm truly grateful for the support! Keep them coming!

I have also received a number of questions about people having issues implementing SideMenu, mostly from beginners learning how to code. As much as I would love to help all of you, I simply do **not** have the time to teach you. I am only supporting bugfixes or reviewing pull requests.

I spent a lot of time putting together a detailed [README](https://github.com/jonkykong/SideMenu/blob/master/README.md), adding comments about usage in code, and provided a [demo project](https://github.com/jonkykong/SideMenu/tree/master/Example). These will give you all the information you need to work through any problem, **saving _you_ the time it takes for me to personally respond.**

### If your question begins with _"How do I..."_
- That's **not** a bug. Go back through the [README](https://github.com/jonkykong/SideMenu/blob/master/README.md). Check out the [demo project](https://github.com/jonkykong/SideMenu/tree/master/Example). Stay persistent, try a few different things, and you will figure it out! **It is generally faster for you to figure it out for yourself instead of waiting for me to respond to you.** I also recommend searching and posting your questions on [stackoverflow.com](stackoverflow.com). If you're interested in hiring me to teach you, please email me using the email address listed at the top of my [README](https://github.com/jonkykong/SideMenu/blob/master/README.md).

### If your question begins with _"How can I..."_
- That's a **new feature request**. I am no longer investing my personal time to implement one-off features because SideMenu currently meets the majority of people's needs with the features it already has. However, this is a great opportunity for you to [join the proud members](https://github.com/jonkykong/SideMenu/graphs/contributors) who have contributed to this open source project! Feel free to open an issue to ask any clarifying questions for your new feature before you start building. Open a [pull request](https://github.com/jonkykong/SideMenu/pull/new/master) when you're ready for me to merge it.

### If your question is about SideMenu not working the way it's described in the [README](https://github.com/jonkykong/SideMenu/blob/master/README.md)...
- This *may* be a bug. You must be able to reproduce the bug in the [demo project](https://github.com/jonkykong/SideMenu/tree/master/Example) which has a minimal amount of code. This helps ensure you don't have a bug in your code unrelated to SideMenu. If the bug is reproducable, open an issue and I will respond to it when I find time.

**Again**, please do **not** email me or open any issues if you want to know how to use SideMenu or are having trouble getting it to do behave a specific way not described in the [README](https://github.com/jonkykong/SideMenu/blob/master/README.md). I am not **tech support**. I am not a **teacher**. If you open an issue while failing to follow these guidelines or use the provided templates your **request for help will be ignored**.

### Thanks again for your support and for being respectful of my time.
I apologize if this seems harsh, but there have been too many developers that have willfully ignored all of this and continued to contact me.
