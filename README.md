## Overview

SideMenu is a simple and versatile side menu control written in Swift.
- [x] **It can be implemented in storyboard without a single line of [code](#code-less-storyboard-implementation).**
- [x] Four standard animation styles to choose from (there's even a parallax effect if you want to get weird).
- [x] Highly customizable without needing to write tons of custom code.
- [x] Supports continuous swiping between side menus on boths sides in a single gesture.
- [x] Global menu configuration. Set-up once and be done for all screens.
- [x] Menus can be presented and dismissed the same as any other view controller since this control uses [custom transitions](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/featuredarticles/ViewControllerPGforiPhoneOS/CustomizingtheTransitionAnimations.html).
- [x] Animations use your view controllers, not snapshots.
- [x] Properly handles screen rotation and in-call status bar height changes.

## Requirements

## Installation
### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate SideMenu into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!

pod 'SideMenu'

# For Swift 2.3 (no longer maintained), use:
# pod 'SideMenu', '~> 1.2.1'
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate SideMenu into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "jonkykong/SideMenu" "master"
```

## Usage
### Code-less Storyboard Implementation
1. Create a Navigation Controller for a side menu. Set the `Custom Class` of the Navigation Controller to be `UISideMenuNavigationController` in the **Identity Inspector**. Set the `Module` to `SideMenu` (ignore this step if you've manually added SideMenu to your project). Create a Root View Controller for the Navigation Controller (shown as a UITableViewController below). Set up any Triggered Segues you want in that view controller.
![](etc/Screenshot1.png)

2. Set the `Left Side` property of the `UISideMenuNavigationController` to On if you want it to appear from the left side of the screen, or Off/Default if you want it to appear from the right side.
![](etc/Screenshot2.png)

3. Add a UIButton or UIBarButton to a view controller that you want to display the menu from. Set that button's Triggered Segues action to modally present the Navigation Controller from step 1.
![](etc/Screenshot3.png)

That's it. *Note: you can only enable gestures in code.*
### Code Implementation
First:
```swift
import SideMenu
```

In your view controller's `viewDidLoad` event, do something like this (**IMPORTANT: If you're seeing a black menu when you use gestures, read this section carefully!**):
``` swift
// Define the menus
let menuLeftNavigationController = UISideMenuNavigationController(rootViewController: YourViewController)
menuLeftNavigationController.leftSide = true
// UISideMenuNavigationController is a subclass of UINavigationController, so do any additional configuration 
// of it here like setting its viewControllers. If you're using storyboards, you'll want to do something like:
// let menuLeftNavigationController = storyboard!.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: "LeftMenuNavigationController") as! UISideMenuNavigationController
SideMenuManager.menuLeftNavigationController = menuLeftNavigationController

let menuRightNavigationController = UISideMenuNavigationController(rootViewController: YourViewController)
// UISideMenuNavigationController is a subclass of UINavigationController, so do any additional configuration
// of it here like setting its viewControllers. If you're using storyboards, you'll want to do something like:
// let menuRightNavigationController = storyboard!.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: "RightMenuNavigationController") as! UISideMenuNavigationController
SideMenuManager.menuRightNavigationController = menuRightNavigationController

// Enable gestures. The left and/or right menus must be set up above for these to work.
// Note that these continue to work on the Navigation Controller independent of the view controller it displays!
SideMenuManager.menuAddPanGestureToPresent(toView: self.navigationController!.navigationBar)
SideMenuManager.menuAddScreenEdgePanGesturesToPresent(toView: self.navigationController!.view)
```
Then from a button, do something like this:
``` swift
present(SideMenuManager.menuLeftNavigationController!, animated: true, completion: nil)

// Similarly, to dismiss a menu programmatically, you would do this:
dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)

// For Swift 2.3 (no longer maintained), use:
// presentViewController(SideMenuManager.menuLeftNavigationController!, animated: true, completion: nil)
```
That's it.
### Customization
Just type `SideMenuManager.menu...` and code completion will show you everything you can customize (defaults are shown below for reference):
``` swift
/**
The push style of the menu.

There are six modes in MenuPushStyle:
- defaultBehavior: The view controller is pushed onto the stack.
- popWhenPossible: If a view controller already in the stack is of the same class as the pushed view controller, the stack is instead popped back to the existing view controller. This behavior can help users from getting lost in a deep navigation stack.
- preserve: If a view controller already in the stack is of the same class as the pushed view controller, the existing view controller is pushed to the end of the stack. This behavior is similar to a UITabBarController.
- preserveAndHideBackButton: Same as .preserve and back buttons are automatically hidden.
- replace: Any existing view controllers are released from the stack and replaced with the pushed view controller. Back buttons are automatically hidden. This behavior is ideal if view controllers require a lot of memory or their state doesn't need to be preserved..
- subMenu: Unlike all other behaviors that push using the menu's presentingViewController, this behavior pushes view controllers within the menu.  Use this behavior if you want to display a sub menu.
*/

/**
The presentation mode of the menu.

There are four modes in MenuPresentMode:
- menuSlideIn: Menu slides in over of the existing view.
- viewSlideOut: The existing view slides out to reveal the menu.
- viewSlideInOut: The existing view slides out while the menu slides in.
- menuDissolveIn: The menu dissolves in over the existing view controller.

## Known Issues
Don't try to change the status bar appearance when presenting a menu. When used with quick gestures/animations, it causes the presentation animation to not complete properly and locks the UI. This was fixed in iOS 9.3. See [radar 21961293](http://www.openradar.me/21961293) for more information.
