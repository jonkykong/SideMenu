## Overview

SideMenu is a simple and versatile side menu control written in Swift.
- [x] **It can be implemented in storyboard without a single line of [code](#code-less-storyboard-implementation).**
- [x] Four standard animation styles to choose from (there's even a parallax effect if you want to get weird).
- [x] Highly customizable without needing to write tons of custom code.
- [x] Supports continuous swiping between side menus on boths sides in a single gesture.
- [x] Global menu configuration. Set-up once and be done for all screens.
- [x] Menus can be presented and dismissed the same as any other view controller since this control uses [custom transitions](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/featuredarticles/ViewControllerPGforiPhoneOS/CustomizingtheTransitionAnimations.html).
- [x] Animations use your view controllers, not snapshots.
- [x] Properly handles screen rotation and in-call status bar height changes.

## Requirements
- [x] Xcode 10.
- [x] iOS 10.0 or higher.

## Installation
### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate SideMenu into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '10.0'
use_frameworks!

pod 'SideMenu'

# For Swift 3 (no longer maintained), use:
# pod 'SideMenu', '~> 2.3.4'
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate SideMenu into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "jonkykong/SideMenu" "master"
```

## Usage
### Code-less Storyboard Implementation
1. Create a Navigation Controller for a side menu. Set the `Custom Class` of the Navigation Controller to be `UISideMenuNavigationController` in the **Identity Inspector**. Set the `Module` to `SideMenu` (ignore this step if you've manually added SideMenu to your project). Create a Root View Controller for the Navigation Controller (shown as a UITableViewController below). Set up any Triggered Segues you want in that view controller.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonkykong/SideMenu/master/etc/Screenshot1.png)

2. Set the `Left Side` property of the `UISideMenuNavigationController` to On if you want it to appear from the left side of the screen, or Off/Default if you want it to appear from the right side.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonkykong/SideMenu/master/etc/Screenshot2.png)

3. Add a UIButton or UIBarButton to a view controller that you want to display the menu from. Set that button's Triggered Segues action to modally present the Navigation Controller from step 1.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonkykong/SideMenu/master/etc/Screenshot3.png)

That's it. *Note: you can only enable gestures in code.*
### Code Implementation
First:
```swift
import SideMenu
```

In your view controller's `viewDidLoad` event, do something like this (**IMPORTANT: If you're seeing a black menu when you use gestures, read this section carefully!**):
``` swift
// Define the menus
let menuLeftNavigationController = UISideMenuNavigationController(rootViewController: YourViewController)
// UISideMenuNavigationController is a subclass of UINavigationController, so do any additional configuration 
// of it here like setting its viewControllers. If you're using storyboards, you'll want to do something like:
// let menuLeftNavigationController = storyboard!.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: "LeftMenuNavigationController") as! UISideMenuNavigationController
SideMenuManager.default.menuLeftNavigationController = menuLeftNavigationController

let menuRightNavigationController = UISideMenuNavigationController(rootViewController: YourViewController)
// UISideMenuNavigationController is a subclass of UINavigationController, so do any additional configuration
// of it here like setting its viewControllers. If you're using storyboards, you'll want to do something like:
// let menuRightNavigationController = storyboard!.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: "RightMenuNavigationController") as! UISideMenuNavigationController
SideMenuManager.default.menuRightNavigationController = menuRightNavigationController

// Enable gestures. The left and/or right menus must be set up above for these to work.
// Note that these continue to work on the Navigation Controller independent of the view controller it displays!
SideMenuManager.default.menuAddPanGestureToPresent(toView: self.navigationController!.navigationBar)
SideMenuManager.default.menuAddScreenEdgePanGesturesToPresent(toView: self.navigationController!.view)
```
Then from a button, do something like this:
``` swift
present(SideMenuManager.default.menuLeftNavigationController!, animated: true, completion: nil)

// Similarly, to dismiss a menu programmatically, you would do this:
dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
```
That's it.
### Customization
#### SideMenuManager
Just type ` SideMenuManager.default.menu...` and code completion will show you everything you can customize (for Objective-C, use `SideMenuManager.defaultManager.menu...`). Defaults values are shown below for reference:
``` swift
/**
The push style of the menu.

There are six modes in MenuPushStyle:
- defaultBehavior: The view controller is pushed onto the stack.
- popWhenPossible: If a view controller already in the stack is of the same class as the pushed view controller, the stack is instead popped back to the existing view controller. This behavior can help users from getting lost in a deep navigation stack.
- preserve: If a view controller already in the stack is of the same class as the pushed view controller, the existing view controller is pushed to the end of the stack. This behavior is similar to a UITabBarController.
- preserveAndHideBackButton: Same as .preserve and back buttons are automatically hidden.
- replace: Any existing view controllers are released from the stack and replaced with the pushed view controller. Back buttons are automatically hidden. This behavior is ideal if view controllers require a lot of memory or their state doesn't need to be preserved.
- subMenu: Unlike all other behaviors that push using the menu's presentingViewController, this behavior pushes view controllers within the menu.  Use this behavior if you want to display a sub menu.
*/
open var menuPushStyle: MenuPushStyle = .defaultBehavior

/**
The presentation mode of the menu.

There are four modes in MenuPresentMode:
- menuSlideIn: Menu slides in over of the existing view.
- viewSlideOut: The existing view slides out to reveal the menu.
- viewSlideInOut: The existing view slides out while the menu slides in.
- menuDissolveIn: The menu dissolves in over the existing view controller.
*/
open var menuPresentMode: MenuPresentMode = .viewSlideOut

/// Prevents the same view controller (or a view controller of the same class) from being pushed more than once. Defaults to true.
open var menuAllowPushOfSameClassTwice = true

/**

Note that each menu's width can be overridden using the `menuWidth` property on any `UISideMenuNavigationController` instance.
*/

@discardableResult open func menuAddPanGestureToPresent(toView: UIView) -> UIPanGestureRecognizer
```
#### UISideMenuNavigationController
`UISideMenuNavigationController` supports the following customizations and properties:
``` swift
/// SideMenuManager instance associated with this menu. Default is `SideMenuManager.default`. This property cannot be changed after the menu has loaded.
open weak var sideMenuManager: SideMenuManager! = SideMenuManager.default

/// Width of the menu when presented on screen, showing the existing view controller in the remaining space. Default is zero. When zero, `sideMenuManager.menuWidth` is used. This property cannot be changed while the isHidden property is false.
@IBInspectable open var menuWidth: CGFloat = 0

/// Whether the menu appears on the right or left side of the screen. Right is the default. This property cannot be changed after the menu has loaded.
@IBInspectable open var leftSide: Bool = false

/// Indicates if the menu is anywhere in the view hierarchy, even if covered by another view controller.
open var isHidden: Bool
```
#### UISideMenuNavigationControllerDelegate
To receive notifications when a menu is displayed from a view controller, have it adhere to the  `UISideMenuNavigationControllerDelegate` protocol:
``` swift
extension MyViewController: UISideMenuNavigationControllerDelegate {

    func sideMenuWillAppear(menu: UISideMenuNavigationController, animated: Bool) {
        print("SideMenu Appearing! (animated: \(animated))")
    }

    func sideMenuDidAppear(menu: UISideMenuNavigationController, animated: Bool) {
        print("SideMenu Appeared! (animated: \(animated))")
    }

    func sideMenuWillDisappear(menu: UISideMenuNavigationController, animated: Bool) {
        print("SideMenu Disappearing! (animated: \(animated))")
    }

    func sideMenuDidDisappear(menu: UISideMenuNavigationController, animated: Bool) {
        print("SideMenu Disappeared! (animated: \(animated))")
    }

}
```
*Note: setting the  `sideMenuDelegate` property on `UISideMenuNavigationController` is optional. If your view controller adheres to the protocol then the methods will be called automatically.*
### Advanced
For simplicity, `SideMenuManager.default` serves as the primary instance as most projects will only need one menu across all screens. If you need to show a different SideMenu, such as from a modal view controller presented from a previous SideMenu, do the following:
1. Declare a variable containing your custom `SideMenuManager` instance. You may want it to define it globally and configure it in your app delegate if menus will be used on multiple screens.
``` swift
let customSideMenuManager = SideMenuManager()
```
2. Setup and display menus with your custom instance the same as you would with the  `SideMenuManager.default` instance.
3. If using Storyboards, subclass your instance of `UISideMenuNavigationController` and set its `sideMenuManager` property to your custom instance. This must be done before `viewDidLoad` is called:
``` swift
class MySideMenuNavigationController: UISideMenuNavigationController {

    let customSideMenuManager = SideMenuManager()

    override func awakeFromNib() {
        super.awakeFromNib()

        sideMenuManager = customSideMenuManager
    }

}
```
Alternatively, you can set  `sideMenuManager` from the view controller that segues to your UISideMenuNavigationController:
``` swift
override func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) {
    if let sideMenuNavigationController = segue.destination as? UISideMenuNavigationController {
        sideMenuNavigationController.sideMenuManager = customSideMenuManager
    }
}
```
*Important: displaying SideMenu instances directly over each other is not supported. Use `menuPushStyle = .subMenu` instead.*
## Known Issues
* Issue [#258](https://github.com/jonkykong/SideMenu/issues/258).
* Don't try to change the status bar appearance when presenting a menu. When used with quick gestures/animations, it causes the presentation animation to not complete properly and locks the UI. This was fixed in iOS 9.3. See [radar 21961293](http://www.openradar.me/21961293) for more information.
